          I am very much delighted to convey my warm greetings to all the Faculty, Staff and the newly admitted students
          of the Barak Valley Engineering College (BVEC). Owing to rapid social and technological changes taking place
          around us, there is an increasing need for quality engineers who can think creatively, apply their
          intelligence to solve problems and to create new designs and products for the ever changing world. Our mission
          is to mould highly competent technical professionals with wide range of analytic, strategic and leadership
          skills capable of facing the challenges of the technical world. Apart from academic activity, BVEC will also
          focus on the all-round development of students in extracurricular activities like sports and cultural
          activities. I envisage BVEC would play a central role in imparting skill development programmes to the youth
          of this region in particular, such that, it helps in local employment generation, prosperity and an overall
          development of the whole society. I hope this institute lives by the saying by Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan,
          "The true teachers are those who help us think for ourselves"-
